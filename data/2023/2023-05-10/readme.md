# US Disease Incidence


## The Dataset

- Epidemiology data are publicly available for US disease incidence, by state
- Yearly records cover period 1928 to 2000
- Variables:
  - disease (Measles, Polio, Rubella)
  - state (AK, AL, AR â€¦)
  - year
  - vaccine (was a vaccine available? TRUE/FALSE flag)
  - Incidence (cases per 100,000 population)

The data can be found [here](US_state_epi_vaccines.csv).

## The Challenge

- Challenge: produce a data visualisation that shows patterns in incidence for each disease area
- How does the incidence change over time?
- How does incidence vary between US states?
- How does incidence change when vaccine is available?
