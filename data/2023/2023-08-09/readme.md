## Background

The PRIMUM study aimed to improve medication appropriateness in elderly patients with multimorbidity. A complex intervention involving general practitioners (GPs) and their healthcare assistants (HCA) was developed and compared to usual care.


## Challenge

Check for a treatment effect on the MAI score after the intervention. Visualize the effect of adjusting the treatment effect for the MAI score at baseline.


## Data

The simulated data set is based on the PRIMUM study (Muth et al., 2016).
The following variables can be found in the data set:

- mai: MAI-Score after the intervention
- gr: group variable
- base.mai: MAI score at baseline

The data can be found [here](MAI.csv).
