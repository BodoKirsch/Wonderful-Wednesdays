# DLQI data

## Background

The DLQI is the most frequently used method for evaluating quality of life for patients with different skin conditions. There are 10 questions, covering the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, treatment. Each question refers to the impact of the skin disease over the previous week and is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).

Melinda Gooderham - one of the authors of the paper using this figure - posted it on LinkedIn and a discussion started about how it could be improved. 


## Data set

The [data set](DLQI_for_AA_by_study.xlsx) contains the means and the difference between the means and the upper whiskers (likely the standard deviation).

## Challenge

Please provide ways to improve this figure to show the impact of the disease on quality of life measured by the DLQI total score ranging from 0 to 30. As an additional challenge, you might think about, how would it look like, if you had access to the original data (feel free to simulate the data).
