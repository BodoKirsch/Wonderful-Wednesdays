# Uncertainty in study planning

## Background

A phase III cardiovascular superiority study is planned with the following assumptions (simplified, no lost-to-FU, no treatment discontinuation, no non-CV death):
* Hazard rate of active comparator 5% per year
* Hazard ratio 0.775
* Accrual time 24 months, total duration 30 months

Statistical settings:
* Logrank test for superiority in time to first MACE event (CV death, MI, stroke)
* Alpha 5%, Power 90%
* A sample size of about 9900 patients would be needed aiming for 650 patients experiencing a MACE event to show superiority of the new treatment over the comparator in reducing MACE events.

## Challenge
How can uncertainty be displayed with regard to total study duration if the assumptions are not exactly met, i.e. comparator hazard rate between 4% and 6% (and hazard ratio between 0.75 and 0.8)?
