# From in-effective to an effective data visualisation - a case study!

When we get involved with data visualisations, we either start from sketch to create outstanding data visualisations or face the situation in which we want to improve an existing data visualisation.

In both situations, we need to fine tune data visualisations over time to get to an outstanding result in the end.

In this first Wonderful Wednesday Webinar of 2022, we will review an existing data visualisation and improve it step by step, making use of gestalt principles, pre-attentive attributes and design considerations.

We will also speak about the power of co-creation and getting feedback from the target audience effectively.
