# CGI-I data example

## Overview

Understanding clinically meaningful differences is important to get a feeling for how relevant changes are on e.g. a patient reported outcome. These are often done by understanding how changes from baseline relate to the overall impression of the physician measured by the CGI-I. 

## The data set

This data set contains 3 variables. The baseline and follow up assessment of the total score (the summary score of the patient reported outcome) and the CGI-I relating to the clinical assessment of improvement. The higher the total score, the worse the symptoms of the patients. The CGI-I ranges from 1 to 7 with 4 meaning no change and 1 and 7 corresponding to very much improved and worsened.

Especially relevant are the scores 3 and 5 and changes relating to these will guide the understanding of minimally clinically relevant changes. The changes relating to a CGI-I of 4 serve as references.

The data can be found [here](WWW_example_minimal_clinical improvement.csv).

## The challenge

The task is to display the relationship between changes from baseline of the total score and the corresponding CGI-I to guide the understanding of clinically relevant changes and especially assess minimal clinically relevant changes.
