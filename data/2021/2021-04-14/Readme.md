# Sustained Response

## Background

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease. For such diseases, it is of interest to not only compare treatments in terms of patients achieving a response, but also in terms of patients sustaining this response once it is achieved. This is the focus of this monthâ€™s challenge: produce a visualization to compare treatments with regards to patients sustaining a response.

The synthetic data contains PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) scores for three treatment groups: two receive an active treatment in different doses; the third receives a comparator. The three arms are balanced, with 300 patients in each. The data contains PASI scores at Baseline and eight follow-up visits, spread over the course of a year.

PASI scores can range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating a worse condition state. The criteriafor response can be chosen, but typical thresholds include a 75%, 90% or 100% reduction in PASI scores relative to Baseline (PASI75/PASI90/PASI100). More than one threshold could also be considered in the same visualization.

## Challenge:

Different approaches could be considered to define a patient as having sustained their response. A simple definition of sustained response could be that having achieved a response at a given visit, a patient then has that response at all subsequent visits. More complex approaches may explore different methods for interpolating between visits.

The dataset also contains a small amount of missing data. It may be of interest to explore how the approach used to handle this missing data influences the interpretation of sustained response.
