## Background
COPD is a disease that effects adults typically aged 40 years or older. It is a chronic condition that effects the lungs of a patient. COPD causes patients to have trouble breathing and can have a major impact on all aspects of their life. Patients who suffer from COPD cannot recover from it as usually it causes scarring in the lung tissue, therefore self-management is an approach will encourages patients to take the necessary steps to limit or reduce the impact COPD has. Interventions for self-management in COPD aim to improve patients' knowledge, skills and confidence to make correct decisions, thus improving health status and outcomes.

 

The intervention is this study was an self-management app that aimed to improve inhaler use and exercise capacity in individuals with COPD. Users of the intervention could access different videos to educate themselves around different topics to better understand COPD and what steps help improve their condition, such as exercise or smoking cessation. Users could also report other detail such as their medication use, their CAT score and even a daily symptom score on how they are feeling that day. All this information could be shared with their doctor who can then monitor and manage patients to ensure they get the right treatment for them.

## Trial Design

This was a 12-week small scale, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial of the app compared with usual care in people with mildâ€“moderate COPD. The aim of the trial was to establish if the delivery of the self-management app would improve patients COPD impact. For this 60 participants were randomised 1:1 to either the app (N=29) or to usual care (N=31) and were stratified by COPD Severity, the study was not fully powered.

## Research Questions/Challenge

In the intervention arm:

* How does individual app usage change over time?
* How does app usage impact individual symptom and CAT scores?

Explore these patterns/relationships visually.
