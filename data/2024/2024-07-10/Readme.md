# Responder definition

## Background

- When a new patient-reported outcome (PRO) is developed, there is interest in deriving the following, to support interpretation of data collected using the new tool:
  - Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) / Responder Definition (RD)
  - Meaningful Between-Group Difference
  - Meaningful Score Categories
- These are usually derived by using an existing, validated measure as the ‘gold standard’ to quantify e.g. disease status


## Data

- Simulated dataset: 1000 subjects, 2 timepoints (Baseline, Week 16)
- Treatment allocation is not important and not provided
- At each time point, data is provided for two tools:
  - PGIS – the “gold standard” – graded on a 4-point scale (‘None’, ‘Mild’, ‘Moderate’, ‘Severe’)
  - ‘NEWTOOL’ – the new measure, scored on an 11-point numeric rating scale from 0 to 10

## Challenge

Use visualisations to support in the derivation in any or all of the following:

- MCID
- Meaningful between-group difference
- Meaningful score categories
