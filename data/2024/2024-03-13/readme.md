# Power and sample size calculations

## Background

As statisticians, we often have to deal with power or sample size calculations. It can be very beneficial to visualise the impact that different factors have on the sample size or power.

## Challenge

Produce data visualisation(s) or share tools that help your audience understand how power and sample size calculations work and what impacts the actual results of these calculations.

You can pick a design with

- any number of treatment groups
- a continuous, categorical/binary, or survival endpoint
- any kind of a null hypothesis (leading, for example, to a superiority or non-inferiority test)
