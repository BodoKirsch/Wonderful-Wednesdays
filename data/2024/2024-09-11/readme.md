Personalized dosing
===================

## Background

Why personalized dosing?

„Again and again, it has been shown that certain patients benefit more from individual drugs, 
while others suffer more heavily from side effects…
…and still they are usually treated with a standard dose."

Fraunhofer Institute for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology, Frankfurt

## Data set

A simulated dose response [data set](WWW54ExampleData.csv) 

* dose: 	dose levels (0, 100, 200 mg)
* target:	continuous response variable (higher is better)
* subgroup variables:
   + bmi (body mass index: ‘low BMI’ or ‘high BMI’)	
   + age (‘<40 years’ or ‘≥40 years’)
   + race (‘Black’, ‘Asian’, ‘White’)
   + sex (‘Female’, ‘Male’)
   + type (type of disease: ‘Acute disease’ or ‘Chronic disease’)


## The Challenge

Aim of the visualisation

* Identify subgroups with a dose response that deviates from the remaining study participants 
* Therewith potential subgroups for personalized dosing could be identified
