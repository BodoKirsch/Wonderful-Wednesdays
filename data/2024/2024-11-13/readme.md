Inter-rater and inter-rater reliability
=======================================


## Data set

- The data is based on a paper by Eliasziw et al., 1994.
- One therapist uses two goniometers (i.e., electro vs. manual) to measure knee joint angles three times.
- Twenty-nine subjects (n=29) were measured three consecutive times (m=3) on each goniometer (t=2) at one joint position (i.e., full passive extension)

The data can be found [here](goniometer.xlsx).


## The Challenge

Visualize the data to answer the following questions:

- Inter-goniometer: do the two goniometers agree?
- Intra-goniometer: do the goniometers measure consistently the knee joint angle across the three repeated measurements?
