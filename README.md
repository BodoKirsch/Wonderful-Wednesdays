# Wonderful Wednesdays

## Learn and Apply Key Principles of Data Visualisations
The data visualization special interest group (VIS SIG) was recently founded under the umbrella of EFSPI and PSI. Learn more about the VIS SIG.

The SIG is happy to introduce a new initiative called “Wonderful Wednesdays”. This initiative will provide the participants to not only learn theoretically about visualisation principles but also apply them to relevant examples from the field of healthcare and the development of new therapies. 

Inspired by ['Makeover Monday'](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) and ['Tidy Tuesday'](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), we will present on a monthly basis a data set reflecting the properties of a usual data set from a clinical trial or some other relevant study. This data set will come along with a visualization. 

Now the audience has the ability to improve the visualization and submit the updated visualization (along with the code) to receive feedback from the SIG members. Both, the presentation of the dataset and the visualization as well as the feedback will be given in webinars. These 60 minutes webinars will occur every 2nd Wednesday of the month at 5pm CET. 

You will be able to submit your improvements for feedback via a google form on the homepage of the SIG after the first webinar. These submissions need to include code (which is well documented and executable) as well as the file of the visualization itself.

We will make the submissions available to the community together with highlights of the strength and limitations. Over time, this will lead to a gallery of visualizations for others to learn from.


## Current data set

* Presented on **August 12th, 2020**. The current example data set focuses on [Adverse events set](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/tree/master/data/2020/2020-08-12). The example dataset is based on a clinical trial of an active treatment for eczema compared to placebo in adolescents that are unresponsive to standard care. The primary outcome was a continuous outcome that measured the extent and severity of eczema at 6 months. Participants were treated with either active treatment or placebo for 6 months and then followed-up for a further 6 months. AEs were monitored and collected for the entire 12 month study period.

Typically adverse events are presented in tables or patient listing. Are there ways to present [Adverse events set](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/tree/master/data/2020/2020-08-12) in a more informative and effective way?
